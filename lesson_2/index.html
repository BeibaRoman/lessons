        <h1 class="hero-title">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</h1>
        <p class="hero-text">
          <mark>The Mercedes-Benz E-Class</mark> is a range of executive cars
          manufactured by German automaker Mercedes-Benz in various engine and
          body configurations. Produced since 1953, the E-Class falls midrange
          in the Mercedes line-up, and has been marketed worldwide across five
          generations. Before 1993, the E in Mercedes-Benz nomenclature was a
          suffix following a vehicle's model number which stood for
          Einspritzmotor (German for fuel injection engine). It began to appear
          in the early 1960s, when that feature began to be utilized broadly in
          the maker's product line, and not just in its upper-tier luxury and
          sporting models. By the launch of the facelifted W124 in 1993 fuel
          injection was ubiquitous in Mercedes engines, and the E was adopted as
          a prefix (i.e., E 220). The model line is referred to officially as
          the E-Class (or E-Klasse). All generations of the E-Class have offered
          either rear-wheel drive or Mercedes' 4Matic four-wheel drive system.
          The E-Class is Mercedes-Benz' best-selling model, with more than 13
          million sold by 2015.[1] The first E-Class series was originally
          available as four-door sedan, five-door station wagon, 2 door coupe
          and 2 door convertible. From 1997 to 2009, the equivalent coupe and
          convertible were sold under the Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class nameplate;
          which was based on the mechanical underpinnings of the smaller C-Class
          while borrowing the styling and some powertrains from the E-Class, a
          trend continued with the C207 E-Class coupe/convertible which was sold
          parallel to the W212 E-Class sedan/wagon. With the latest incarnation
          of the E-Class released for the 2017 model year, all body styles share
          the same W213 platform.[2] Due to the E-Class's size and durability,
          it has filled many market segments, from personal cars to frequently
          serving as taxis in European countries, as well special-purpose
          vehicles (e.g., police or ambulance modifications) from the
          factory.[3] In November 2020, the W213 E-Class was awarded the 2021
          Motor Trend Car of the Year award, a first for Mercedes-Benz.[4]

        <p class="first-generation-text">
          The <mark>"E-Class"</mark> name first appeared with the facelifted
          W124 in 1993 for the model year 1994 (the W124 was introduced in 1984
          but continued with the older naming convention until 1993 when all
          Mercedes-Benz models switched to a new system, e.g. E 320 instead of
          300 E). The diesel versions continued to be the fuel economy option
          over the four and six-cylinder gasoline engines, and the gasoline
          <a

            >V8 engines </a
          >(available after 1992) increased gasoline power outputs further.
          Four-cylinder gasoline models were not marketed in the United States.
          The V8-powered sedans/saloons were named 400 E/500 E from 1990 to
          1993, and E 420/E 500 after 1993. Likewise, the 3.0-liter cars (e.g.
          300 E) were also re-badged to E 320 with the new 3.2-liter M104
          engines and naming rationalization of 1994. For the diesel models, the
          name change was less elegant, with the 250 D becoming the E 250 Diesel
          for example. Sedan (W124), Coup√© (C124), Convertible (A124), and
          Estate (S124) body configurations were offered.

        <p class="second-generation-text">
          The <mark>W210</mark> E-Class, launched in 1995, brought the line
          firmly into the upper end of the mid-size luxury market. The E-class
          made major changes compared to the earlier version of the E-class,
          including four large oval headlights, which gave Mercedes an updated
          image intended to attract more younger buyers and women. The new
          E-class was 1.6 in (4.1 cm) longer and 2.3 in (5.8 cm) wider and
          offered significantly more interior room but was still considered
          mid-size.[5][6] In September 1999, the W210 E-class was facelifted.
          This included visual, mechanical, and quality improvements over the
          earlier versions. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class was

          wagon version continued to be sold until March 2003 when the S211
          wagon returned the S210 wagon.

          Launched in 2002, <mark>the W211</mark> E-Class was another evolution
          of the previous model. The W211-based C219 CLS-Class 4-door coupe was
          introduced as a niche model in 2005, primarily to attract a younger
          demographic. The W211 E-Class was facelifted in June 2006 for the 2007

          The <mark>W212 </mark>replaced the W211 in 2009 (as a 2010 model).
          Official photos of the W212 were leaked on the internet on 9 December
          2008 ahead of its 2009

          unveiling.[7] Scans of a leaked brochure were posted onto the internet
          in January 2009, detailing the whole E-Class range including the new E
          200 CGI and E 230 CGI with direct injected forced induction engines.
          New features included a blind spot monitor, Lane Keeping Assist,
          Pre-safe with Attention Assist, and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_night_vision"
            >Night View Assist </a
          >Plus. In the United States the E-Class was priced nearly US$4,600
          less than the previous model.[8] The W212 estate was also announced
          and available from November 2009.[9] In 2013, the E-Class was
          comprehensively facelifted, featuring significant styling changes,
          fuel economy improvements, and updated safety features. Daimler
          invested close to ‚Ç¨1 billion into the development of the extensive
          refresh, making it likely the most expensive mid-life facelift in the
          history of the automobile.[10][11] The biggest change was the singular
          front lights replacing the twin headlamp design (marking the end of
          Mercedes's dual headlamps use) with integrated LED DRLs.[12] Although
          not an all-new model, the W212 facelift was the only mid-cycle refresh
          featured on a family portrait of several generations of the E-Class
          side by side by Mercedes-Benz for the unveiling of the W213
          E-Class.[13][14] While the factory has rated the E63S model at 577
          hp/590 tq, there is significant real-world dynamometer testing that
          indicates the AMG-tuned S model exceeds 600 hp at the flywheel.

          >.[19] While the W212 E-Class has tighter surface and harder edges,
          the new model is curvier and more flowing.[20] Engine options for the
          W213 E-Class saw a major update, thanks to the switch to inline-6
          cylinder engines from the previous V6 engines,[21] along with a new
          generation of four-cylinder diesel engines, codenamed OM654, and
          existing four-cylinder petrol engines.[22] The W213 E-Class is the
          second most technologically advanced Mercedes after the new S-Class.
          The E-Class received the latest in autonomous driving technology for
          use at highway speeds, capable of piloting itself up to speeds of 130
          mph (210 km/h) for up to 2 minutes. The system uses a complex array of
          motion sensors, radars, and cameras to scan the road ahead, and
          requires the driver's hands to be placed on the wheel at all
          times.[23][24] This feature was also available on the 4th generation
          Mercedes-AMG E 63 model. In 2020, Mercedes-Benz introduced a facelift
          to the W213.
