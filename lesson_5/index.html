            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image" target="_blank" class="about-link">images</a>,
          typically composed
          of many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(paper)" target="_blank" class="about-link">pages</a>
          (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] It
          can also be a handwritten or printed work of fiction or nonfiction, usually on sheets of paper fastened or
          bound together within covers. The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In
          the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces
          its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.

        <p class="about-text">
          As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a
          considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. In a
          restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting
          that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by
          the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book. In an unrestricted sense, a book is
          the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can
          consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book,
          the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account
          book, appointment book, autograph book, notebook, diary or sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages
          thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be
          distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than
          a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any
          non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's
          seven-volume In Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or
          newspaper. An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or, colloquially, "bookworm". Books are
          traded at both regular stores and specialized bookstores, and people can read borrowed books, often for free,
          at libraries. Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published.[2]
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of
          e-books.[3] However, in most countries, printed books continue to outsell their digital counterparts due to
          many people still preferring to read in a traditional way.[4][5][6][7] The 21st century has also seen a rapid
          rise in the popularity of audiobooks, which are recordings of books being read aloud.[8]

        </h2>
        <p class="importance-text">
          Reading is a very good habit that one needs to develop in life. Good books can inform you, enlighten you and
          lead you in the right direction. There is no better companion than a good book. Reading is important because
          it is good for your overall well-being. Once you start reading, you experience a whole new world. When you
          start loving the habit of reading you eventually get addicted to it. Reading develops language skills and
          vocabulary. Reading books is also a way to relax and reduce stress. It is important to read a good book at
          least for a few minutes each day to stretch the brain muscles for healthy functioning.

              Reading is an essential aspect of learning and has multiple benefits attached to the exercise. Reading is
              important because it makes you more empathetic, and knowledgeable and stimulates your imagination. A study

                class="importance-link" target="_blank">University of Sussex</a> showed that reading reduces <a

              Medicinal therapies to combat depression can be reduced by incorporating reading habits. This is exactly

              seven-part cycle, was published in 1913. In it, Proust introduces the themes that run through the entire
              work. The narrator recalls his childhood, aided by the famous madeleine; and describes M. Swann's passion
              for Odette. The work is incomparable. Edmund Wilson said "[Proust] has supplied for the first time in
              literature an equivalent in the full scale for the new theory of modern physics."</p>

            <p class="books-text">
              One of the 20th century's enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed
              novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize–winning career. The novel
              tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía
              family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the
              noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in
              the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and
              revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility — the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the
              search for peace and truth — these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair
              of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always
              writes with the simplicity, ease, andpurity that are the mark of a master. Alternately reverential and
              comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new
              consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an
              accounting of the history of the human race.

            <p class="books-text">
              The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos
              of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as
              the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as
              mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in
              organized crime, for example the Jewish mafia. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel,
              idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the
              lack of morality that went with it, a kind of decadence.
