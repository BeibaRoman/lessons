          <h2 class="history-title" id="history-title-id">The Early years</h2>
          <p class="history-text">Mercedes has been involved in motor racing even before the term “motor racing” was
            coined.
            The Mercedes-Benz marque we know today was created following a merger of a German industrial machine
            production
            company Benz & Companie Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik (Benz & Cie) and a German engineering company
            Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) in 1926. The new company was named Daimler-Benz (today known as Daimler
            AG).
            Its motorsport roots can be traced all the way back to the first ever motor race, the 1894 Paris-Rouen,
            where
            a
            single Benz vehicle driven by Émile Roger finished 14th. On the other side of the future partnership, DMG
            built
            its first race car in 1902 – the Mercedes Simplex. The vehicle dominated racing before the First World War.
            Benz’s involvement in motor racing continued throughout the 1910s with the Blitzen-Benz (introduced in 1909)
            and
            in the 1920s with the Benz Tropfenwagen (introduced 1921). By the end of the 1920s Benz & Cie ran into
            financial
            difficulties which led to the merger with DMG and the formation of Daimler-Benz.</p>

          <h2 class="history-title" id="history-title-1-id">The 1930s – Rise of the Silver Arrows</h2>
          <p class="history-text">The 1930 saw Daimler-Benz and its Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows dominate Grand Prix
            racing in Europe. Led by the legendary team manager Alfred Neubauer, Mercedes-Benz and its main rival Auto
            Union, won all European Grand Prix Championships from 1934 until they withdrew form racing in 1939, ahead of
            the Second World War. In the process they produced many legendary cars such as the Mercedes-Benz W25 (1934
            to 1936), W125 (1937), W154 (1938 and 1939), and W165 (1939), which were driven by motorsport greats Rudolf
            Caracciola, Manfred von Brauchitsch, Richard Seaman and many others.</p>
          <div class="local-container"></div>
          <h3 class="history-title" id="history-title-2-id">Why the “Silver Arrows”?</h3>
          <p class="history-text">Mercedes’ racing cars are nowadays instantly recognizable by their traditional silver
            color, so the question seems a bit redundant. However the story of how they got the famous color is the
            stuff of motorsport legend. Firstly its important to establish that the “Silver Arrows” name was given to
            German racing teams, both Mercedes and Auto Union. Back in the old days each country was assigned a color
            that made them instantly recognizable, for example Italian cars were painted red, British cars were painted
            dark green, French cars were painted blue, while German cars were painted white (interchangeable with silver
            as both colors share the same heraldry tincture).
            However according to Alfred Neubauer’s account of the origin of the Silver Arrows given in 1958, Mercedes
            started using the color silver by accident. The story goes that Mercedes’ new car- the W25 was originally
            painted white, but after it was deemed around 1kg too heavy ahead of the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring in
            1934, a desperate Neubauer (and in some accounts driver Manfred von Brauchitsch) decided to scrape off the
            lead-based paint which helped the car meet the 750kg maximum weight limit. Without paint the silver aluminum
            surface of the car was exposed and, after von Brauchitsch won the race, the media nicknamed Mercedes’ cars –
            the Silver Arrows.</p>

              Information</a>, Statistics and Standings

            The Car: Mercedes-Benz W196
            WDC Positions: Juan Manuel Fangio, P1; Karl Kling, P5; Hans Herrmann, P6; Hermann Lang, N/A

            In 1953 Daimler-Benz decided it was time for Mercedes to return to Grand Prix racing. The return happened in
            1954 when the Mercedes brand entered Formula 1, after 14 years away from motorsport (the F1 championship was
            established in 1950). The team, led by Alfred Neubauer, entered their latest vehicle – the Mercedes-Benz
            W196, an advanced machine that ran in two configurations – as an open-wheeler and as a wider streamlined
            version.

            The 1951 World Champion, Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio, transferred from Maserati to Mercedes in round
            four of the championship, just in time for the German outfit’s debut at the 1954 French Grand Prix. Mercedes
            dominated the race scoring a 1-2 victory with Fangio and Karl Kling. Another Mercedes driver, Hans Herrmann,
            recorded the fastest lap of the race. In addition to those three, Hermann Lang also drove for the team in
            round 6 – the German Grand Prix.

            The campaign finished with Fangio taking the Drivers’ Championship, scoring 4 pole positions and 4 wins for
            Mercedes. The Formula 1 Constructors’ Championship wasn’t introduced until 1958.</p>

            P22; André Simon, N/A

            The 1955 season was Mercedes’ first full Formula 1 season. Throughout the campaign the team hired several
            drivers: Juan Manuel Fangio, Karl Kling, Stirling Moss, Hans Herrmann, André Simon and Piero Taruffi. An
            updated version of previous year’s Mercedes-Benz W196 was again used and further developed throughout the
            season. The team was dominant with 4 pole positions and 5 wins out of 7 races (Fangio won 4, while British
            driver Stirling Moss famously won his home British Grand Prix). Fangio again picked up the Drivers’
            Championship for the team, ahead of Moss who finished the season in second place.

            The Car: Mercedes MGP W01
            WDC Positions: Nico Rosberg, P7; Michael Schumacher, P9
            WCC Position: P4
            In 2010 Mercedes returned to Formula 1 as a works team after Daimler AG bought a 45.1% stake in Brawn GP,
            with their partner Aabar Investments acquiring an additional 30%. Ross Brawn continued on as Team Principal.
            The team was rebranded Mercedes GP Petronas Formula One Team.
            The team’s history can be traced back to Tyrell Racing, a team that competed in F1 from 1970 until 1998,
            when it was bought by British American Tobacco and renamed British American Racing. BAT invested serious
            money into the operation and built a high-tech modern HQ in Brackley that is being used by Mercedes to this
            day. The team changed ownership again in 2006 when it was bought by Honda and renamed Honda Racing F1 Team.
            Honda withdrew from F1 at the end of 2008 and the team was sold to Ross Brawn and Nick Fry who renamed it
            Brawn GP. After winning the double crown in their first season, at the end of 2009 Brawn and Fry decided to
            sell the majority stake in the team to Daimler AG and Aabar Investments.
            Wanting to start the first season of Mercedes’ return to Formula 1 in a big way, Brawn lured his former
            collaborator, seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher back to Formula 1 (the German retired after the
            2006 season). Nico Rosberg (son of 1982 F1 champion Keke Rosberg) was chosen as Schumacher’s team-mate,
            completing an all-German lineup behind the wheel of the all-new Mercedes MGP W01.
            Unfortunately the first year back proved to be a tough one for the German manufacturer. The team’s best
            results were three third-place finishes by Nico Rosberg at Sepang, Shanghai and Silverstone. Rosberg
            ultimately finished the season in 7th place, while Schumacher was 9th, without a single podium to his name.
            Mercedes finished the season in 4th place, behind Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari.
